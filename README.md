## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-finance-app-backend.git
   cd personal-finance-app-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/personal-finance-app
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Create required directories:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/uploads/avatars
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

| Variable    | Description                         | Default                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| PORT        | Server port                         | 5000                                           |
| MONGODB_URI | MongoDB connection string           | mongodb://localhost:27017/personal-finance-app |
| JWT_SECRET  | Secret key for JWT token generation | (Required)                                     |
| NODE_ENV    | Application environment             | development                                    |

## Security

The application implements several security best practices:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based with proper secret management
- **Data Validation**: Complete input validation using Joi schemas
- **Password Security**: Passwords hashed using bcrypt
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request throttling
- **Security Headers**: Implemented using Helmet
- **CSRF Protection**: For routes that use cookie-based authentication
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handler that prevents leaking sensitive information

## Testing

Testing implementation is planned using Jest. To run tests (once implemented):

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

- [ ] Enhanced analytics and reporting features
- [ ] Third-party service integrations (e.g., bank APIs)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Subscription and premium features
